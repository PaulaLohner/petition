# Food is life - online petition

This was one of the projects I've done while on the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. <br><br>

The idea behind this project was to create an online petition that visitors can sign to make their voice heard. Once signed, the petition site will redirect the user to a page where they can see they're handwritten signature and confirm it. There can only be one signature per email so if the user wish to redo the process they must delete it and sign the petition one more time.
